ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jackolivertfl, I'm an analyst in the Strategic Analysis team within City Planning at TfL.

Much of my work involves Python, automating existing analytical processes in ouurteam and attempting to find new answers 
in the many data sources we have available to us. I also have a keen interest in connectivity analysis and many of the 
scripts in this repository are tools to analyse variuous aspects of London's transport network connectivity.
